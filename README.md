# ATM System Simulation

This project is to analyze and evaluate the requirements to design and implement an ATM system and to test the functionality of the software of an ATM component, consistent with the requirement specification.
It also offers a secure transaction channel and access to other associated capabilities.


### Actors involved

- **Customer** : Customers are the bank account holders that use the ATM machine to remotely manage their account without going to the bank. They interact with the system to perform the following transactions - view account details withdraw cash, transfer funds to another account and change their account security PIN.

- **Authenticator** : The authenticator is responsible for validating a customer that interacts with the ATM. The user is only granted access if all details and checks are correct.

- **Bank** : Bank refers to the financial institution which also contains the database that holds all users and their account details. It too has all the control over the userâ€™s accounts.

- **Operator** : The ATM machine operator controls the status and operation of the machine. He can bring the machine offline for reloading the cash dispenser cassettes or other maintenance purposes.

### Available Services
- **View account details**
 - **Withdraw cash**
 - **Transfer amount to another account**
